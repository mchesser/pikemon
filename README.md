* Battle the other player's party by talking to them.

## Future features?

* Allow players to trade with each other.
* Synchronise NPCs? (This may have major issues).

## Bugs

* Need restrictions for interacting with players without pokemon.
* Players that are on different map ids cannot see each other, even if they are within viewing distance.
